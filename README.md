# 🔧 Creality K1C Optimized Klipper Configuration – for Low Noise and Heat

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/422fa4dc-0607-4898-9a8c-12313d2ab870)

Welcome to the optimized Klipper configuration for the **Creality K1C** 3D printer.

This setup enhance your printing experience by reducing noise and heat output, making your printer more suitable for home environments — without compromising speed or performance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Quiet. Tuned stepper motor settings**  
  Carefully tuned motor parameters reduce overall printer noise from **50 dB to 35 dB**, significantly improving comfort for home or office use.

- **Reduced Heat**  
  By lowering the current power to the **X, Y, Z, and E stepper motors**, this configuration minimizes system heat. Despite the reduction in power, there is **no loss in speed or precision**, ensuring reliable and high-quality prints.

- **Quiet fan PWM profiles**  
  Custom PWM settings for part and hotend cooling fans allow for **quieter airflow** without sacrificing cooling efficiency. This further reduces acoustic noise during both idle and active printing phases.

- **Refined Motion Settings**  
  Motion system parameters are tuned to ensure smooth, responsive movement with minimal resonance or vibration.
